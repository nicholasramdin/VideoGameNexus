                The Witcher 3 won Video Game of the Year, as well as awards for Excellence in Technical Achievement and Excellence in Narrative. Bloodborne, Undertale, and Rise of the Tomb Raider also received multiple wins, taking home two each. The full list of SXSW Awards winners are available below.

                "CD Projekt Red created something tremendously special with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and that's why it's our Video Game of the Year," SXSW Gaming Producer Justin Burnham said in a statement. "The characters are rich, the gameplay is fantastic and the intricate story makes it a pleasure to get lost in the world. It's a prime example of a game that pushes the limits of what digital entertainment can accomplish."

            <p>Prior to today, Naughty Dog's The Last of Us was the most awarded game of all time, standing with 249 CONFIRMED GAME OF THE YEAR AWARDS. Its record didn't last for long, though.

                Following the selection of GDC's game of the year award this week, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has secured its spot as the most awarded game in history with a total of 251 awards. On the way it has not only toppled The Last of Us, but legendary games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Half-Life 2, and Resident Evil 4.

                The awards for 2015 have been unanimous. While Fallout 4 would hold 56 awards, Bloodborne 31, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain 29, more than 75% of critics agreed that The Witcher 3 was the highlight of the year. Unsurprisingly, it holds a 93 Metascore.

                The Witcher 3 won our runner-up for GAME OF THE YEAR 2015 and a multitude of nominations. CD Projekt Red also won our BEST DEVELOPER OF 2015.

                To be fair to past years, there are currently more outlets than ever before making it nearly impossible for older games to have held the record for any substantial length of time.

                The Witcher 3 has been heralded for its storytelling, visuals, and wealth of content. Some RPG fans even consider it the best open-world RPG of all-time.

            <h3>Batman comes to 'Fortnite' along with Catwoman and Gotham City</h3>

            It didn't take long to learn just what Epic had in store for Batman's arrival in Fortnite. The brooding superhero is available in the battle royale shooter from now through October 6th, and he's definitely not alone. You can get a Batman cape and buy a Caped Crusader pack that, among other cosmetics, includes both a comic book hero outfit as well as a Dark Knight movie version. However, there's also a Catwoman outfit, and Gotham City itself is in the game -- there's an appropriate backdrop for your adventures, including the option to fly like Batman with unlimited re-use of your glider.

            There's appropriate free gear and rewards as well. A Grapnel Gun helps you cover distances rapidly by hurtling you into the air, while an Explosive Batarang doubles as both an immediately explosive weapon and a proximity mine if you stick it in a wall. Complete challenges until October 1st, meanwhile, and you can earn cosmetics like a Catwing glider and Batman-themed imagery.

            This is far from the first major Fortnite tie-in. The Avengers movies, John Wick and the NFL have all had their turn, among others. It's not often that Epic changes the environment quite so conspicuously, though, and Batman seems an appropriate fit for a game that thrives on swooping in from above -- though we're pretty sure he might balk at having to kill legions of people to emerge triumphant.

            <h3>Game Freak recieves backlash on new upcoming Pokemon Game!</h3>


        </div>

            The biggest controversy surrounding Pokémon Sword and Shield was the announcement that not every Pokémon will be obtainable in the Gen 8 games. Junichi Masuda of GameFreak said as much during the E3 2019 Nintendo Treehouse Live demo. The upcoming Pokémon Home app for smartphones, which acts like Pokémon Bank, won't be able to transfer every 'mon from past games into Sword and Shield.

            GameFreak deliberated extensively to figure out which Pokémon to include. Masuda wrote a letter explaining the team's decision further.

            "There are a couple of different parts to the thinking behind it, but really the biggest reason for it is just the sheer number of Pokémon," Masuda explained. "We already have well over 800 Pokémon species, and there's going to be more added in these games. And now that they're on the Nintendo Switch, we're creating it with much higher fidelity with higher quality animations. But even more than that, it's coming down to the battle system. We're making sure we can keep everything balanced and give all the Pokemon that appear in the games a chance to shine.</p>

        <p>

            "We knew at some point we weren't going to be able to indefinitely keep supporting all of the Pokémon, and we just found that Sword and Shield would probably be a good point to go back and reevaluate what would be the best selection of Pokémon that appeal to the widest audience while keeping into consideration the balance of the battle system. It isn't just going to be all-new Pokémon in the Galar region Pokedex; there's still going to be a lot of favorites that fans will be able to bring over that they've adventured with previously. But yeah, it was pretty much just balancing and getting this optimal selection of Pokémon for the adventure we wanted to provide."

            However, the announcement was not met with understanding from the Pokémon Community. Hashtags like "bring back national dex" and more continue to flood Pokémon's social media accounts months after the announcement.
